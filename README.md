# newpipeToNewsboat
A Python script that converts the export file from Newpipe into a file useable by Newsboat, so that you can enjoy those sweet RSS feeds.
The result will be both printed to console and written to a new 'result.txt' file.

##  Command
```bash
$ python3 newpipe-to-newsboat.py NEWPIPE_EXPORT_FILE.json
```
__Disclaimer__ : The script will output a file 'result.txt'. If an existing file has the same name, it will be __ERASED__. You've been warned.
